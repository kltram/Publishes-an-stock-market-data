The scope of this test application used to display the 3rd party API data into frontend but without any even event from FE,It mean if the data is updated on server side then immediatly the FE will update automatically.
 
In this application I used the third pary API "https://nseindia.com/live_market/dynaContent/live_watch/stock_watch/niftyStockWatch.json"

Here I created 2 application.

  websocket-frontend-example - Technology
  1. Angular JS 
  2. Spring boot using SockJS, StompJS and Spring WebSocket.
